Parser Generator

This project is a parser generator much like LEXX or YACC written in C and C++. It takes the input grammar files and outputs parsing tables that can be read in any language.

I got the idea from the GOLD parser engine. The difference is that the input files for this parser generator can take pseudocode for rules like ignore, accept, goto etc.
It outputs the compiled grammar/lexer files into a compressed format called Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) that's about as efficient as ZIP compression,
but doesn't have the overhead.

This parser generator can be used to parse files that can't be parsed with a standard LALR grammar. The implementation includes the ability to output C style switch statement source files in .h and .c format.

Some example parsers are included for different input files.

The parsers generated by this software are much faster than hand-coding parsers for custom languages. And with the ability to use pseudocode in the source files,
special cases can me made to handle weird input anomalies.

New language output types can be added easily. The DFA lexer tables are optimized. There is a small bug in the C runtime parser engine for certain grammar files that I haven't bothered to fix yet, but anyone is welcome to do it.
